# generate names from All first names and then assing them to rooms
#the rooms will give certain x and y min and max parameters that
#the names can randomly appear in. Thus assing them, xy pos. Then
#Tell them all to go to specific point, however, make sure that they
#do not bump into eachother. If walk into each other and bumps, moves away
#certain amount, all the while still trying to get out of door
#Thus, need walls to be concreate and the pople to be too. As long as can
#them out door, the problem is solve. Perhaps also add timer at the end
