These files were compiled using the MOBY word lists and the UK Advanced Cryptics Dictionary. For example: if a word was in the MOBY parts of speech list as a verb, and it was in the MOBY hyphenated list as having two syllables, and then the word was found in the UK Advanced Cryptics Dictionary, then it was filed away in the two-syllable verbs list. Also some work was done on adding plurals of nouns and 3rd person parts of verbs. I have noticed the odd error and corrected them but I expect there will be a few more. For instance, maybe in the 2 syllable verb list, you'll find a word that isn't 2 syllables and/or is not a verb this means you've found an error - I hope, however, that the lists, in 999 cases out of 1000, will be accurate and useful. My dream word list would be the UK Advanced Cryptics Dictionary with parts of speech, numbers of syllables, pronunciation (for rhyming)(including stressed syllables), and a thesaurus-list. Add to that a front-end multiple-choice find program with a regular-expressions function. - Search: 'sh' and 'ss' sounds in a 3 syllable noun, with a stressed middle syllable that rhymes with 'clean', and a final syllable that rhymes with 'est', its meaning must be linked to a person's occupation that typically would take place in a factory.
